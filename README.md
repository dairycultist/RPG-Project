Simple quirky fantasy NSFW RPG.

Basic save-the-princess story; you're some faceless knight whose princess' crown (that gives her magical fat powers and the right to rule the kingdom) was stolen by an evil witch.

states:
- world map
- dialogue (overlaid on top of world map; can have a character portrait + name or not)
- pause menu (overlaid on top of world map; manage items/party)
- battle
- shop

custom sprites for scene backgrounds, in-scene sprites, and dialogue portraits. tilemap for world map
