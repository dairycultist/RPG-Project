Simple roguelike NSFW RPG with dialogue, world navigation, and combat.

basic save-the-princess story; each run, you attempt to descend deeper into the dungeon. no party system (enemies during combat "look out of the screen" like earthbound, since there's no point in a "face-to-face" system like pokemon if it's just you)

states:
- world map
- dialogue (overlaid on top of world map; can have a character portrait + name or not)
- pause menu (overlaid on top of world map; manage items/party)
- battle
- shop

custom sprites for scene backgrounds, in-scene sprites, and dialogue portraits. tilemap for world map
