; Objects are notated with a colon. There can be many objects of the same type per block.
; Parameters are notated with an equals sign. There should only be one parameter with a given key per block.
; Objects contain parameters. Objects can also contain other objects (such as with rooms and colliders).
; Indentation, spacing, and line breaks should be exact (my code is not very good).
; The top-level block itself behaves like an object.
